# Project Malware Rhapsody.
# Goal:
 Research Linux's security for fun and education.
 
# How to use..

fish> cargo run -- -simplest-trap-fish

Now try run sudo..

fish> sudo echo "uttermost security"

You'll get..

[sudo] password for root:

Yeah, You're absolutely right ==>> Something has got utterly wrong.. if You enter Your password - You'll see that..

hey-ho, Dear Researcher, i am..
root

So, root gets hijacked from this point with very dumb trick. :)

# Humble user erases root stuff..

bash> sudo mkdir /dev/shm/delIT <br>
bash> cargo run -- -humble-user-del-root-stuff -num-thr >> Number of threads << <br>
+++ <br>
the more threads the better. But Rust's runtime prevents too many ones. So, workaround is to run parallel instances of Malware Rhapsody. Actually, there can be three outcomes..

>> Root-owned folder will be deleted. <br>
>> Hardware will be damaged with extreme overheating. <br>
>> Both. <br>

# Ways to mitigate that threat are..
>> <b> UNDERCLOCKING.. <b> then other sub-methods become useful. <br>
>> <b> KILL processes w/ too much Power consumption <b> ==>> rather useful too. <br>

# A little Remark..
> This threat is major for any operating system, because it attacks hardware per se. Electrically unstable readings make possible to suppress security tokens/descriptors.
